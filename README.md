# Printing
<br/><br/>
All parts are printed with 100 infill and normal support touching buildplate.
10-20mm Brim is recommended to prevent warping.
The screws for the ballscrew nut housing are just heated up really heavy with a small blowtorch and then pressed in.
The pocket for the nut may require some postprocessing. I took a batch of sandpaper and rolled it up and then pushed it 
into the pocket and gave it a long sanding until the nut slides in easily without any tension.
If there is tension and the slide does not move easily heating the slide up heavily until the flanges deform against
the HGR Blocks will remove the tension. The slide on my build moves very smooth.
I heated thing up multiple times and the ballscrew nut slit into the pocket with a tiny bit of play after sanding.
